# Learning 'readxl'

We are working with data in readxl and it's going to be amazing!

We're giong to use the following packages:

```{r packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(writexl)
library(here)

### Read in fish counts



```

# install.packages ("package_name")
```{r}
  #### read in the fish_counts_curated.csv
fish_counts <-read_csv(here("R-workshop-data", "fish_counts_curated.csv"))
